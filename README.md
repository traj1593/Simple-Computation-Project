# Simple-Computation-Project
Write a program that asks a user for the diameter of a circle. Then use that value to compute the circumference of the circle and print the result in this format: "The circumference of a circle of diameter %D is %C." where %D is the diameter given to you and %C is the calculated circumference. The variables you use for diameter and circumference ought to be of type float. [HINT: the circumference of a circle is the diameter multiplied by pi (3.14159)]

SIMPLE COMPUTATION PROGRAM
There are four simple computation program specifications below. You ought to be able to do any of
them, but I’m asking you to develop just one (your choice) for submission by the end of the week. Do
not submit more than one. In the program specifications, I give variable names starting with the %
character. I did this because variables that Python variables cannot contain the % character … this
forces you to make up your own variable names. Please do your own problem-solving and refrain from
copying answers to these simple problems from internet sites. Use only the techniques and functions I
have demonstrated. To avoid penalties, start early and follow all of the instructions provided in the
supplements regarding console user interfaces and source code formatting.
● <circumference1> Write a program that asks a user for the diameter of a circle. Then use that
value to compute the circumference of the circle and print the result in this format: "The
circumference of a circle of diameter %D is %C." where %D is the diameter given to you and %C
is the calculated circumference. The variables you use for diameter and circumference ought to
be of type float. [HINT: the circumference of a circle is the diameter multiplied by pi (3.14159)]
● <circle_area> Write a program that asks a user for the diameter of a circle. Then use that value
to compute the radius and area of the circle and print the result in this format: "The area of a
circle of radius %R is %A.", where %R is the calculated radius and %A is the calculated area. The
variables you use for diameter, radius and area ought to be of type float. [HINT: the area of a
circle is pi times the radius squared]
● <perimeter> Write a program that asks a user for the height and width of a rectangle. Then use
those values to compute the perimeter of the rectangle and print the result in this format: "The
perimeter of a %H by %W rectangle is %P." where %H is the height, %W is the width and %P is
the calculated perimeter. The variables you use for width, height and perimeter ought to be of
type float. [HINT: the perimeter is the sum of the sides: two times height plus two times width].
● <rectangle_area> Write a program that asks a user for the height and width of a rectangle. Then
use those values to compute the area of the rectangle and print the result in this format: "The
area of a %H by %W rectangle is %A." where %H is the height, %W is the width and %A is the
calculated area. The variables you use for width, height and area ought to be of type float.
[HINT: The area of a rectangle is height times width]
